First step is for students to clone this repository.
From there, read `read-me-first.txt` to proceed.

Once students have assembled the solution text files in `/solution/`, run `codeconcatenator.py` in `/scripts/`. 
*Note that codeconcatenator.py is actually misspelled in the directory, but too tired to change it*

For the third clue, you have to find a commit hash to restore the file.
